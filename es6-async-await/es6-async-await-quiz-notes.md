## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the `async` and `await` keywords used for?
  await - JS runtime should wait until the asynchronous function completes
  async - declares an async function
- How do `async` and `await` differ from `Promise.then` and `Promise.catch`?
  async/await can declare directly and returns value // promise returns a promise
- When do you use `async`?
  to dictate whatever function to be run later
- When do you use `await`? When do you _not_ use `await`? (What happens if you `await` a synchronous function?)
  usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression
  when you want something to be ran right away
  js still turns non promise item to resolved value
- How do you handle errors with `await`?
  pass function to happen if it fails
  wrap it in a try await then catch as final?
- What do `try`, `catch` and `throw` do? When do you use them?
  try - statement defines a code block to run
  catch - statement defines a code block to handle any error
  throw - statement defines a custom error.
- What happens if you forget to use `await` on a Promise? In that case, what happens to the Promise rejection?
  the value is lost?
- Which style of asynchronous programming do you prefer â€” callbacks, `Promise.then`, or `async/await`? Why?
  async/await because shawn said so
